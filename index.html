<section class="about">
  <div class="container about">
    <div>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I combine structured thinking with creativity — starting with user
        problems, validating assumptions early, and keeping teams focused on
        outcomes rather than outputs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a tech enthusiast with a passion for making work smarter, not harder. With 8+ years in Product Management and Scrum, I’ve led teams through full product cycles—from discovery to delivery—while optimizing workflows and eliminating inefficiencies. Proud to have worked on impactful projects, from simplifying urban travel with the Bratislava public transport app to optimizing waste management at Sensoneo. I’ve also helped streamline fintech solutions, making life easier for wealth and asset managers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thrive on solving problems, eliminating inefficiencies, and driving continuous improvement—always with people at the center.
      </p>
       <p>
       Let’s connect and make things better, together!

          “Viki has been responsible for one of our WealthTech products as a Business Analyst and later Product Owner. She quickly built a team and a team culture that produced outstanding results. Viki has extensive and detailed knowledge of the financial industry, and has a very strong talent in establishing a shared understanding between stakeholders and development teams. Her methodological knowledge and experience in specifying sophisticated requirements in a way that is understandable and to the point is very helpful. Viki is remarkably thorough and conscientious in her work. It is a great pleasure to work with her because you can always count on her due to her commitment and reliability. The mood in her team has always been very positive because she creates a very pleasant and productive working atmosphere with her friendly, open and constructive manner. In addition, she has always discussed, coordinated and agreed on the necessary prioritization of the tasks at hand with everyone involved. Viki puts the agile mindset very skillfully into practice by regularly giving but also accepting feedback. For me personally, it was a great enrichment to have met and worked with Viki, and I can unreservedly recommend her to all teams that want to master complex and complicated challenges in high quality.”
